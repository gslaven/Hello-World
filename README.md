Greg Slavens

50ish years old and struggling to re-learn technologies that might help me get back into a tech related job.  Former Front/Back-end developer using outdated technologies as old as MS ACCESS and as new as SQL SERVER 2012.  Trying to learn GitHub, HTML 5, Node.JS, Angular, and Ionic, so that I can dust off my resume a little and add some small glimmers of sunshine in it.

Life happened to me about 2 years ago and I lost my job, but since then I have worked some meanial jobs and done just enough to survive.  I stopped drinking...pause for applause...Hardest thing I have ever done.  Now I have to try and find a meaningful way to make a living and support myself.  So I came here with a goal of creating my first Mobile App and I welcome any and all help with that goal.

Thanks,
Greg
